# traffic_sign_clasification_GTSRB
Application of the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) on two Convolutional Neural Networks(VGG16 and InceptionV3) using a Python deep learning library called Keras

### Prerequisites 
- Python 3.5
- SciPy with NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Keras
- Theano/Tensorflow

- Also, NVIDIA CUDA needs to be installe and make sure to use GPU since makes the training process faster.
